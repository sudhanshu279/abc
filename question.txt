Suppose you are working in a data-driven job role, and you have to answer all these questions.
1) First, write a code where, by changing just the keyword, we can search for multiple things.
2) Top 15 countries where the keywords are searched the most, and also create visual representation of it.
3) A world map needs to be plotted showing the countries that search the keyword the most.
4) We need to extract the time-wise interest of the keyword — how it trended in different years.
5) Compare related keywords and plot the graph.

                           
                           
                            Pytrends
                                  
 Pytrends is an unofficial Python library that allows easy access to Google Trends
data through Google’s internal API. Since Google doesn’t provide an official
public API for Trends data, Pytrends acts as a smart wrapper around Google's
web interface, enabling data analysts and developers to extract trend data for
various keywords, regions, and timeframes.
It is especially useful for:
•Market research
•Trend forecasting
•Competitive analysis
•Keyword research for SEO
